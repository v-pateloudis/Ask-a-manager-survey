# Ask-a-manager-survey

This is an ongoing data preprocessing project. The data was taken from askamanager.org, and can be found here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPS5dBSGtwYVbjsfbaMCYIWnOuRmJcbequohNxCyGVw/edit?resourcekey#gid=1625408792

The dataset has numerous columns and loads of "freestyle" entries, and the purpose of this project is to tidy the data into useable shape, and then create meaningfull visualizations. Columns are edited and dropped, and the data is filtered before finally being presented in colourfull graphs. The code contains explanations upon every step, to guide the reader through my process of... preprocessing.
